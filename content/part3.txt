Future - AVIF, JPEG XL

  1. History
    a. Version 1.0.0 of the AVIF specification was finalized in February 2019.
    b. By AOMedia
  2. How better than now, past
    a. AV1 also uses a new compression technique: chroma-from-luma. Most image formats store brightness separately from color hue. AVIF uses the brightness channel to guess what the color channel may look like. They are usually correlated, so a good guess gives smaller file sizes and sharper edges.
